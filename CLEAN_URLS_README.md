# Clean URLs Implementation

## Overview
This website now supports clean URLs (URLs without .html extensions) while maintaining compatibility with all environments.

## How It Works

### 1. Production Environment (with Apache server)
- **`.htaccess`** file handles URL rewriting
- Users can access pages with clean URLs: `example.com/events`
- URLs are automatically redirected from `example.com/events.html` to `example.com/events`
- All internal navigation works seamlessly

### 2. Local Development Environment
- **`url-handler.js`** script detects local environment
- All internal links continue to work with .html extensions
- No URL rewriting is applied (since .htaccess doesn't work with local servers)
- Navigation remains functional during development

## Files Modified

### Core Clean URL System:
- **`.htaccess`** - Apache URL rewriting rules for production
- **`js/url-handler.js`** - JavaScript fallback for environment detection and link handling

### HTML Files Updated (with url-handler.js):
- `index.html`
- `about-us.html`
- `accommodations.html`
- `apply-visa.html`
- `booking.html`
- `dubai-packages.html`
- `events.html`
- `flight-booking.html`
- `freight-services.html`
- `gallery.html`
- `hatta-road-trip-details.html`
- `hotel-booking.html`
- `job-seekers.html`
- `more-attractions.html`
- `plan-your-travel.html`
- `shop.html`
- `tours.html`
- `visa-services.html`

## Google Analytics
All HTML files have been updated to fix Google Analytics formatting issues:
- Fixed spacing between `</script>` tags and `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- Ensures proper Google Analytics tracking across all pages

## Testing

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Start local server (Python)
cd "c:\Users\user\Desktop\last option\Yuvinalis-tour"
python -m http.server 8000

# Access via browser:
http://localhost:8000
```

### Production Testing:
When deployed to an Apache server:
- Clean URLs will work automatically: `yoursite.com/events`
- .html URLs will redirect to clean URLs: `yoursite.com/events.html` â†’ `yoursite.com/events`

## Benefits

1. **SEO Friendly**: Clean URLs are better for search engine optimization
2. **User Friendly**: Shorter, cleaner URLs in the address bar
3. **Professional**: Modern web standard for URL structure
4. **Performance**: Includes caching and compression optimizations in .htaccess
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Old .html links still work (redirect to clean URLs)

## Implementation Details

### url-handler.js Features:
- Environment detection (local vs production)
- Smart link handling for internal navigation
- Console logging for debugging
- Non-intrusive operation (doesn't break existing functionality)

### .htaccess Features:
- URL rewriting to remove .html extensions
- 301 redirects for SEO preservation
- Performance optimizations (caching, compression)
- Optional HTTPS enforcement (commented out)

## Troubleshooting

### If clean URLs don't work in production:
1. Ensure your hosting provider supports .htaccess files
2. Verify Apache mod_rewrite is enabled
3. Check that .htaccess file is in the root directory
4. Ensure file permissions allow reading .htaccess

### If navigation breaks:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify url-handler.js is properly loaded
3. Ensure all internal links use relative paths with .html extensions

## Future Maintenance

- When adding new HTML pages, include `<script src="js/url-handler.js"></script>` before the closing `</body>` tag
- Keep all internal links with .html extensions in the HTML files
- The system will handle clean URL display automatically
