## How It Works

### Production Environment
1. The `.htaccess` file automatically redirects old `.html` URLs to clean URLs (301 redirects for SEO)
2. Clean URLs are mapped back to the actual HTML files
3. The `url-handler.js` script updates the browser URL display
4. All internal links work seamlessly with the new clean URL structure

### Local Development
1. The `url-handler.js` script detects local development environment
2. Links continue to work with `.html` extensions for reliability
3. No URL rewriting is applied during local development

## SEO Benefits
- **Clean URLs**: More user-friendly and professional appearance
- **301 Redirects**: Preserves search engine rankings during transition
- **Meaningful Paths**: URLs clearly indicate page content
- **Better User Experience**: Easier to remember and share URLs

## Technical Implementation
- **Server-side**: Apache `.htaccess` with mod_rewrite
- **Client-side**: JavaScript fallback for enhanced functionality
- **Cross-compatible**: Works with and without JavaScript enabled

## Testing
To test the clean URLs:
1. Upload files to Apache server with mod_rewrite enabled
2. Visit any old `.html` URL - it should redirect to clean URL
3. Visit clean URLs directly - they should load the correct pages
4. All internal navigation should work seamlessly
