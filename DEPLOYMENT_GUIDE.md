## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Files
Upload all files to your Apache web server:
```
├── .htaccess (✨ NEW)
├── index.html (🔧 UPDATED)
├── apply-visa.html (🔧 UPDATED)
├── flight-booking.html (🔧 UPDATED)
├── hotel-booking.html (🔧 UPDATED)
├── events.html (🔧 UPDATED)
├── [all other HTML files] (🔧 UPDATED)
├── js/
│   └── url-handler.js (✨ NEW)
├── css/
│   └── [all CSS files]
└── images/
    └── [all image files]
```

### Step 2: Server Requirements
Ensure your Apache server has:
- ✅ `mod_rewrite` enabled
- ✅ `.htaccess` files allowed
- ✅ AllowOverride set to "All" or at least "FileInfo"

### Step 3: Test Clean URLs

#### 🧪 **Test File Created**
Open `test-clean-urls.html` to verify functionality:
- **Local Development**: Links work with `.html` extensions
- **Production**: Links automatically redirect to clean URLs

#### 🔗 **Test These URLs After Deployment**:

**Old URLs (should redirect):**
- `https://yourdomain.com/apply-visa.html` → `https://yourdomain.com/visa/`
- `https://yourdomain.com/flight-booking.html` → `https://yourdomain.com/flights/`
- `https://yourdomain.com/events.html` → `https://yourdomain.com/events/`

**Clean URLs (should work directly):**
- `https://yourdomain.com/visa/`
- `https://yourdomain.com/flights/`
- `https://yourdomain.com/hotels/`
- `https://yourdomain.com/events/`

## ✨ Benefits

### 🎯 **User Experience**
- **Professional URLs**: Clean, memorable, and user-friendly
- **Better Navigation**: Intuitive URL structure
- **Social Sharing**: URLs are easier to share and remember

### 🔍 **SEO Benefits**
- **301 Redirects**: Preserves search engine rankings
- **Keyword-Rich URLs**: Better for search engine optimization
- **Canonical URLs**: Prevents duplicate content issues

### 🛠️ **Technical Benefits**
- **Backward Compatible**: Old `.html` URLs still work (redirect)
- **Cross-Compatible**: Works with and without JavaScript
- **Development Friendly**: Local testing remains unchanged

## 🔧 How It Works

### 🏠 **Local Development**
```javascript
// url-handler.js detects localhost
const isLocalDev = window.location.hostname === 'localhost';
// Links continue to use .html for reliability
```

### 🌐 **Production Environment**
```apache
# .htaccess redirects old URLs to clean URLs
RewriteRule ^apply-visa\.html$ /visa/ [R=301,L]

# Maps clean URLs back to HTML files
RewriteRule ^visa/?$ apply-visa.html [L]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If Clean URLs Don't Work:**
1. **Check mod_rewrite**: `apache2ctl -M | grep rewrite`
2. **Check .htaccess permissions**: Should be readable by Apache
3. **Check AllowOverride**: Must be "All" or "FileInfo" in Apache config
4. **Check server logs**: Look for rewrite errors

### **If Links Don't Work:**
1. **Check JavaScript Console**: Look for url-handler.js errors
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Test Different Browsers**: Ensure cross-browser compatibility
